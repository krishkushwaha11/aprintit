                    <p><b>What is Application Security?</b></p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Application security is the practice of keeping software applications secure from
                        threats and vulnerabilities. This includes the prevention of SQL injections, XSS, or data
                        breaches by deploying relevant security measures during both application development and
                        deployment phases. In addition to those mentioned, security coding, encryption, authentication,
                        and routine security reviews improve application security. Risk mitigation can be achieved
                        through firewalls, access controls, and patch management. There is cooperation between
                        developers and security experts to maintain an application’s functionality and security. With
                        users’ data remaining protected, application security integrates proactive measures to combat
                        new threats to the software’s infrastructure. Varying threats can be effectively dealt with
                        employing a multitude of measures.</p>

                    <p><b>Managed Application Security Services</b></p>
                    <p>Strengthen the security of your applications effortlessly with the help of risk management and
                        expert help. Trust skilled application security professionals to aid in process management and
                        reduction of target exposure. Modern automated assessments of web applications as well as APIs
                        incorporate real-world attack techniques to identify possible threats. As a result, all examined
                        application policies have provisions against potential targets of these nefarious techniques.
                        For security deficient departments, managed application security focuses on simplifying
                        detection and resolving threats, which improves oversight while increasing coverage.
                        Organizations are better positioned to remediate gaps and improve application security
                        effectiveness through the elimination of non-critical risks and alerts.</p>
